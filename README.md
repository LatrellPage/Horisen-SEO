Horiseon Social Solution Services Accessibility Update

Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. is a marketing agency that helps businesses increase their customers. The company provided starter code for their website, but needed it to be updated to be more accessible for end users. In this project, I updated the code to make it more accessible and user-friendly.

Purpose
The purpose of this project was to update the Horiseon Social Solution Services website to improve accessibility for all users, including those with disabilities. This was achieved by making changes to the website's code and layout.

Features
The following features were added to the website to improve accessibility:

- Fixed the "search engine optimization" button to properly link to the correct section of the page.
- Added the title "Horiseon" to the page to improve SEO and provide a clear title for users.
- Added alt texts behind images to provide information for users who may be using screen readers or have images disabled.
- Bolded and/or made font sizes larger to improve readability and make important information stand out.
- Changed sub titles to black to provide better contrast and improve readability.
